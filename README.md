# AWS Lambda for sending logs from S3 to New Relic

`s3-log-ingestion-lambda` is an AWS Serverless application that sends log data from an S3 bucket of your choice to New Relic.

## Requirements

To forward data to New Relic you need access to a [New Relic License Key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key).

## Support

New Relic hosts and moderates an online forum where customers can interact with New Relic employees as well as other customers to get help and share best practices. Like all official New Relic open source projects, there's a related Community topic in the New Relic Explorers Hub.
